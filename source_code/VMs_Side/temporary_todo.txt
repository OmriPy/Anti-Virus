Sorted by importance

Project:
* In server.py, when an unknown socket has connected, instead of exiting, use 'continue' to keep the loop going
* Rebuild the client code, use 3 classes:
  1 - Client socket
  2 - GUI
  3 - Main class (connecting between the client and GUI classes)
  Add: `class Page(QFrame)` that will server a page. Then in the GUI class, when the connect_to_server button is clicked,
  remove the current page by doing `page.setParent(None)` and adding the new page to the layout.
* Tell the clients everytime a virus was detected
* Think about the ip the anti viruses and the clients connect to. on client VMs, the ip should not be localhost
