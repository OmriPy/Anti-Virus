Sorted by importance

Project:
* Think if you should replace `if lock != None` with `if lock is not None` in colored printing
* Change back the names of the private variables you named to names you like because it's just VSCode thinking they're functions
* Change names according to python naming convention
* Change class Page to class Screen
* Set each screen to be exactly at the middle of the entire screen
* Think if you should handle ProtocolError-s inside protocol.py other than repeating the handling code
* Do something about the fact that ProtocolError is too much generic to understand what it means
* Make anti_virus.py work also on windows (the equivalent of ps -a in windows is tasklist)
