Sorted by importance

Project:
* Think if you should handle ProtocolError-s inside protocol.py other than repeating the handling code
* Do something about the fact that ProtocolError is too much generic to understand what it means
* Make anti_virus.py work also on windows (the equivalent of ps -a in windows is tasklist)
* Add `class Label(QLabel)`
