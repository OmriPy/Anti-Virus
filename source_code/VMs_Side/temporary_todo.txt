Project:
* add a message for closing connection between two sockets and implement it
* think about the ip the anti virus connects to. on client VMs, the ip should not be localhost
* differentiate the anti_virus from the other clients in the server. more specifically, add a message that says
  "hi, I'm the anti virus" or something like that, and handle it in a separate "handle_client()" function for itself.
  do that in order to keep the communication between the server and the anti_virus always open in case a virus
  was detected
* manage Protocol exceptions in server
* ‚Å†think about whether to tell the anti virus to send a message to the server every time a virus was NOT detected or not.
  Not sending is preferable.
* Add lock to the threads implementation of the server
