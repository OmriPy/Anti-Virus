Whenever you run out of tasks, add tasks from todo.txt in the repo to here

General:
*   See what you can do about not using the protocol send and recv in secure connection establishment,
    because can't decode those bytes. Maybe add functions that send and recv with bytes
*   Continue as much as possible with the book
*   Draw the super drawing.

Do after next meeting:
*   Add settings screen where you can update the user details nad remove account.
*   Add option to remove account (implement in server and database as well)
*   Change phone number field to password hint field, and if the user gets the error
    "Password is incorrect" a lot of times (decide how many times), display the hint
    for the password of the user
