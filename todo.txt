        - Create the Antivirus Server. Becuase a socket server is required.
          The server will get notification from an attacked client and send it to all clients. - DONE
        - Add multiclient functionallity to the server. Because a multiclient server is required - DONE
        - Think about the ip the anti viruses and the clients connect to. on client VMs, the ip should not be localhost

    Operating systems:
        - Make sure that the multiclient server is using multithreading - DONE
        - Make sure that the virus detector uses the OS API to detect the virus - (DONE, I think)
        - Add to the antivirus server a database of the virus signatures (like process name or behavior)
    Security:
        - Add encryption to the antivirus server-client protocol
    GUI:
        - Add "virus detected" notification to the antivirus client

Nice to have:
- Create a simple vulnerable app - DONE
- Make the vulnerable app open to the web - DONE
- Create a virus
- Create a virus server that attacks the vulnerable web app and runs the virus on the victim PC
- Add to the virus and its server command running functionallity
