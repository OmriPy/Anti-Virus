Note: Sorted by order of importance

Must have - basic functionallity:
- Define virus as the whatsapp application: `ps aux | grep WhatsApp`
- find a virus by checking if name of a running proces is name of a virus
- prevent virus from doing its things

Important - must for project requirements:
    OOP:
        - Make sure that the entire project uses at least 4 OOP classes
    Networking:
        - Create a protocol for the antivirus and it's server
        - Create the Antivirus Server. Becuase a socket server is required. 
          The server will get notification from an attacked client and send it to all clients.
        - Add multiclient functionallity to the server. Because a multiclient server is required
    Operating systems:
        - Make sure that the multiclient server is using multithreading
        - Make sure that the virus detctor uses the OS API to detect the virus
    Security:
        - Add encryption to the antivirus server-client protocol
    GUI:
        - Add "virus detected" notification to the antivirus client

Nice to have:
- Create a simple vulnerable app - DONE
- Make the vulnerable app open to the web
- Create a virus
- Create a virus server that attacks the vulnerable web app and runs the virus on the victim PC
- Add to the virus and it's server command running functionallity
- Add to the antivirus server a database of the virus signatures (like process name or behavior)
