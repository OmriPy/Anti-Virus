Note: Sorted by order of importance

Must have - basic functionallity:
- Define virus as the whatsapp application: `ps aux | grep WhatsApp` - DONE
- find a virus by checking if name of a running proces is name of a virus - DONE
- prevent virus from doing its things - DONE

Important - must for project requirements:
    OOP:
        - Make sure that the entire project uses at least 4 OOP classes - DONE
    Networking:
        - Create a protocol for the antivirus and its server - DONE
        - Create the Antivirus Server. Becuase a socket server is required.
          The server will get notification from an attacked client and send it to all clients. - DONE
        - Add multiclient functionallity to the server. Because a multiclient server is required - DONE
        - Think about the ip the anti viruses and the clients connect to. on client VMs, the ip should not be localhost
    Operating systems:
        - Make sure that the multiclient server is using multithreading - DONE
        - Make sure that the virus detector uses the OS API to detect the virus - (DONE, I think)
        - Install another kali linux in order to have 3 VMs
    Database:
        - Add to the antivirus server a database of Users - DONE
        - Implement registration and sign in screens in client - DONE
        - At least 4 input fields in registration - DONE
    Security:
        - Add encryption to the protocol
    GUI:
        - Add "virus detected" notification to the user - DONE
    Book:
        - Add a screenshot of the list of used VMs which is in VMware Fusion Library
        - Add to technologies (modules) list: VMware Fusion
        - Note that the clients are Kali Linux machines
        - Explain in detail the conecpt of the LAN inside the VMs
        - Add a "super" drawing which describes the machines used in the project. Within each one, draw the project's softwares used in it.
          Think of it like combining the drawing of the machines in Notes app and the drawing in drawio which is in this repo.

Nice to have:
- Create a simple vulnerable app - DONE
- Make the vulnerable app open to the web - DONE
- Create a virus
- Create a virus server that attacks the vulnerable web app and runs the virus on the victim PC
- Add to the virus and its server command running functionallity
