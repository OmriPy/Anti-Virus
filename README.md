# Virus that is Controlled by an External Server and can Spread out into other Computers in the LAN
*Explanation of the project*

## Prerequisites
*Prerequisites*

## LAN Configuration
Our goal here is to connect all of the Virtual Machines to a new LAN that will be private to them. Which means that the VM's network won't even be accessible to the main Operating System of the Laptop, just like your home's Wi-Fi isn't accessible to the White House for example.

### Creating the Private Network
For every VM that is Not the Router, we change the Network Adapter settings to Private to my Mac.

Select the VM -> right click -> `Settings` -> `Network Adapter` -> select `Private to my Mac`.
